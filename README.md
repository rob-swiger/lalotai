# Lalotai Design System

### What is Lalotai?
Lalotai is the Design System used by PlusOne Priorities, LLC, based in Southwest Virginia. Version 1.0 is based upon [Bootstrap 4 (beta 3)] (http://getbootstrap.com) and [jQuery] (http://jquery.com). Lalotai uses [Font Awesome 5] (http://fontawesome.com) SVG icons (free version). Future versions will branch out into [Vue.js] (http://vuejs.org) or [React.js] (http://reactjs.org).

### Where does the name come from?
Pronounced lah-low-tie, Lalotai was named after a scene in Disney's 2017 film, Moana, where it was used as the name of the Realm of Monsters in the movie. Lalo means “below” and tai means “the sea” in Proto Polynesian. (Proto-Polynesian is the hypothetical proto-language from which all the modern Polynesian languages descend. Historical linguists have reconstructed the language using the comparative method, in much the same manner as with Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Uralic.)
